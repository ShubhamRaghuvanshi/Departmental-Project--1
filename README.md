# Departmental-Project--1

The code uses Pythia to simulate the process pp -> Z -> mu+ mu- in the Leading Order(LO) and to generate the corresponding standard model QCD background, ROOT-CERN is used for data analysis.

The code can be run simply using the makefile. 
The Detailed report for the project is provided in the pdf file.
